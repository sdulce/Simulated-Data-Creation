# Simulated-Data-Creation
This document will showcase an analysis on the data created from projects 1 and 2.  The analysis will show important data points and explanations of the code that mined that data.

1. This code identifies the top car brands, models, and paint colors by counting occurrences in the respective columns of a DataFrame. It splits the Car Brand & Model column into Brand and Model, calculates the sales count for each unique value using .value_counts(), formats the results into DataFrames, and displays the top 5 entries for each category.
